<h1 align ="center"><span>UFO Sightings Database Using<br/>JavaScript and DOM Manipulation</span></h1>

A code was written to create a table dynamically based upon the [dataset that was provided](https://github.com/leslievazquez/Javascript_Challenge/tree/main/Resources/StarterCode). The table allows users to filter the table data for specific values related to UFO sightings. The code was written using Javascript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js. 

Below are the steps taken to create this project:

### UFO Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search 

*URL to Web Dashboard: https://leslievazquez.github.io/Javascript_Challenge/UFO-level-1/index.html*

- Create a basic HTML web page or use the [index.html](https://github.com/leslievazquez/Javascript_Challenge/tree/main/Resources/StarterCode/index.html) file provided.
- Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
  - Create a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.
- Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories 

*URL to Web Dashboard: https://leslievazquez.github.io/Javascript_Challenge/UFO-level-2/index.html*

- Complete all of Level 1 criteria.
- Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:
  - `date/time`
  - `city`
  - `state`
  - `country`
  - `shape`
