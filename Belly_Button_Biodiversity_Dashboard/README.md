# Purpose
This repository was built as an interactive dashboard to explore which microbes have colonized in human navels of the study subjects.   

A small amount of the microbial species were present in a majority of study subjects (more than 70%), while the rest were relaively rare in comparison.   

# Interactive Webpage
Use the below link to go to the interactive webpage.  You can select the test subject from the drop down list and the chart will display all of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the OTU vs Sample Values bar chart and bubble chart.
